"Dylan, where are we going today after school?"
"There's a new boba shop in Promenade Mall. Let's go there!"
"Too bad Scott can't join us..."
What do you do? Remember, you have an assignment to finish!
Ignore them and focus on your task.; SUCCESS; Good job :)
Approach them and tell them that you will join them soon.; MID; This is okay, but don't let your friends influence your choices. You have an assignment to do!
Follow them to the mall. You can do your assignment tomorrow.; FAIL; You succumbed to peer pressure. You don't need to go to the mall with them in order to be accepted!
