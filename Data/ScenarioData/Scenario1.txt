"Dylan, where are we going today after school?"
"There's a new boba shop in Promenade Mall!"
"Too bad Scott isn't here..."
What do you do? Remember, you have an assignment to finish!
Ignore them and focus on you task; SUCCESS; Good job :)
Approach them and tell them that you will join soon; MID; This is okay, but don't let your friends change your mind. You have an assignment to do!
Tell them that you are here and follow them to the mall.; FAIL; You succumbed to peer pressure. You don't need to go to the mall with them in order to be accepted!
