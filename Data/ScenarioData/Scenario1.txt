Dylan, where are we going today after school?
There's a new boba shop in promenade mall!
Too bad <> isn't here...
What do you do?
Tell them that you are here and follow them to the mall.; FAIL; You failed because you succumbed to indirect peer pressure
Approach them and tell them that you will join soon; MID; This is okay, but you should have ignored them.
Ignore them and focus on you task; SUCCESS; Good job :)
