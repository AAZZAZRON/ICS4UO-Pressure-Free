Dylan, where are we going today after school?
There's a new boba shop in Promenade Mall!
Too bad Scott isn't here...
What do you do? Remember, you have an assignment to finish!
Tell them that you are here and follow them to the mall.; FAIL; Finishing your assignment is more important than being with your friends. Don't succumb to the peer pressure.
Approach them and tell them that you will join soon; MID; This is okay, but don't let your friends change your mind. You have an assignment to do!
Ignore them and focus on you task; SUCCESS; Good job :)
