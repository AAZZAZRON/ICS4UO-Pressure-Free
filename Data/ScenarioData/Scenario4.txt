"Yo, you got the new Jordan sneakers?"
"Yeah man, I got them yesterday!"
*Those Jordans are the new trendy sneakers!*
"Nice. I'll buy mine today after school."
What do you do?
Join them and buy the sneakers.; FAIL; Wrong. You don't need to buy a pair of Jordan sneakers in order to fit in! True friends won't care about your apparel.
Buy the sneakers later; MID; This is okay, but don't let your friends negatively influence your decisions. Jordans may be cool, but they are just a brand!
Ignore them and focus on you task; SUCCESS; Nice! You recognized and avoided peer pressure.
