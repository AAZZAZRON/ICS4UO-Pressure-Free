I'm so bored...
You wanna skip class and watch the new Marvel movie?
Sure, oh wait look, it's <>
Yo, come follow us.
What do you do? Remember, you have an assignment to finish!
Join them and watch the movies.; FAIL; Finishing your assignment is more important than being with your friends. Don't succumb to the peer pressure.
Wach the movie and finish the task after; MID; This is okay. However, pushing priorities to the side under friend's influence can lead you to succumb to greater peer pressure.
Say no and focus on your task; SUCCESS; Good job :)
