# Pressure-Free
ICS4O ISP created by Aaron Zhu (Project Manager) and Sion Gang (Project Member)

The goal of *Pressure-Free* is to educate students, grade 6-12, on how to overcome peer pressure in a school environment. Especially for young students, who are not fully capable of being independent yet, peer pressure is a serious issue that many face on a daily basis.
