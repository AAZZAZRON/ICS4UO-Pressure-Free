The goal of *Pressure-Free* is to educate students, grade 6-12, on how to overcome peer pressure in a school environment. Especially for young students, who are not fully capable of being independent yet, peer pressure is a serious issue that many face on a daily basis.

**Level 1: Deficiency Room**
- Player will learn about peer pressure

**Level 2: Panic Room**
- Player will be quizzed on peer pressure

**Level 3: Escape Room**
- Player will play as the main character, Scott, who is collecting all his materials for an assignment while dealing with peer pressure.
