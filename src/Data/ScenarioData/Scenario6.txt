"Let's go ask the principal if we can start a tutoring club!"
"Should we get Scott to come as well?"
"He's not here right now. He can probably email the principal later..."

What do you do? Remember, you have an assignment to finish!
Go join them to tell the principal together. Your assignment can wait.; FAIL; Finishing your assignment is more important. You can also email the principal.
Ask them to speak with the principal tomorrow, so you can be there too.; MID; This is okay as it is positive peer pressure. However, do not let negative peer pressure influence you!
Ignore them and focus on your assignment.; SUCCESS; This is a good choice. This is positive peer pressure.
